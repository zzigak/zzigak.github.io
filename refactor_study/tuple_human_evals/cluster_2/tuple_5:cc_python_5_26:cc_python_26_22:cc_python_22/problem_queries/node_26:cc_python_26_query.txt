Nastia has an unweighted tree with n vertices and wants to play with it!

The girl will perform the following operation with her tree, as long as she needs:

  1. Remove any existing edge. 
  2. Add an edge between any pair of vertices. 



What is the minimum number of operations Nastia needs to get a bamboo from a tree? A bamboo is a tree in which no node has a degree greater than 2.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10 000) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the number of vertices in the tree.

Next n - 1 lines of each test cases describe the edges of the tree in form a_i, b_i (1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n, a_i ≠ b_i).

It's guaranteed the given graph is a tree and the sum of n in one test doesn't exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.

Output

For each test case in the first line print a single integer k — the minimum number of operations required to obtain a bamboo from the initial tree.

In the next k lines print 4 integers x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2 (1 ≤ x_1, y_1, x_2, y_{2} ≤ n, x_1 ≠ y_1, x_2 ≠ y_2) — this way you remove the edge (x_1, y_1) and add an undirected edge (x_2, y_2).

Note that the edge (x_1, y_1) must be present in the graph at the moment of removing.

Note

Note the graph can be unconnected after a certain operation.

Consider the first test case of the example: 

<image> The red edges are removed, and the green ones are added.
